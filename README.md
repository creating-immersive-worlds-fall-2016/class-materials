# class-materials
This repo contains all of the class materials for Creating Immersive Worlds, including course materials, sample projects and templates.

## Getting Started
If you'd like to get a headstart on the course, here's some tasks:

### Stuff to Download
1. Download and Install **Unity3D** (http://www.unity3d.com/download) and 
2. Download and Install **Blender** (https://www.blender.org/)
3. Download and Install **Git** (https://git-scm.com/) on your computer
4. Download and Install **Audacity** (http://audacityteam.org/download/) 

### Stuff to Do 
I've listed a few *totally optional* things to do if you'd like to play around with some of the tools we'll be using in class. As a sign of solidarity, I have personally gone through these myself and timed how long it took!

1. Create your account on Github (like, right up in the upper right-hand corner of your screen) and email me your account name
2. Make your first game by following their excellent tutorial here (http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/roll-a-ball) - 1h 30 minutes 
3. Watch and follow along with the basic Blender tutorials here (https://cgcookie.com/course/blender-basics/) - 50 minutes
